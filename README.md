```
i'm better known as j3s, but i got this cool 4-char github profile name and i'm keeping it :3

most of my repos are on my personal site[1], the cyberia git server[2] or sourcehut[3]

some of my more "public" stuff is kept here, simply bc github
is an octopus-cat of significant size. it's almost impossible to escape
its tentacles.

anywaysszzz, have a good day and stuff.
